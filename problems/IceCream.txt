Schneider’s Sweet Shop specializes in homemade candies and ice cream. 
Schneider produces its ice cream in-house, in batches of 50 pounds. 
The first stage in ice cream making is the blending of ingredients to 
obtain a mix which meets pre-specified require- ments on the percentages 
of certain constituents of the mix. The desired composition is as follows:

1. Fat                  16.00%
2. Serum solids         8.00%
3. Sugar solids         16.00% 
4. Egg solids           .35%
5. Stabilizer           .25%
6. Emulsifier           .15%
7. Water                59.25%

The mix can be composed of ingredients from the following list:

Ingredient Cost ($/lb.)
1. 40% Cream                                $1.19 
2. 23% Cream                                .70 
3. Butter                                   2.32 
4. Plastic cream                            2.30 
5. Butter oil                               2.87 
. 4% Milk                                   .25 
7. Skim condensed milk                      .35 
8. Skim milk powder                         .65 
9. Liquid sugar                             .25
10. Sugared frozen fresh egg yolk           1.75 
11. Powdered egg yolk                       4.45 
12. Stabilizer                              2.45 
13. Emulsifier                              1.68 
14. Water                                   .00

The number of pounds of a constituent found in a pound of an ingredient is shown in the next list. 
Note that a pound of stabilizer contributes only to the stabilizer requirement (one pound), one pound
of emulsifier contributes only to the emulsifier requirement (one pound), and that water contributes
only to the water requirement (one pound).

Young Jack Schneider has recently acquired the shop from his father. 
Jack’s father has in the past used the following mixture: 
9.73 pounds of plastic cream, 3.03 pounds of skim milk powder, 
11.37 pounds of liquid sugar, 0.44 pounds of sugared frozen fresh egg yolk, 
0.12 pounds of stabilizer, 0.07 pounds of emulsifier, and 25.24 pounds of water. 
(The scale at Schneider’s is only accurate to 100th of a pound.) 

Jack feels that perhaps it is possible to produce the ice cream in a more cost-effective manner. 
He would like to find the cheapest mix for producing a batch of ice cream, which meets the requirements specified above.
Jack is also curious about the cost effect of being a little more flexible in the requirements listed above. 
He wants to know the cheapest mix if the composition meets the following tolerances:

1. Fat                          15.00 – 17.00%
2. Serum solids                 7.00 – 9.00%
3. Sugar solids                 15.50 – 16.50%
4. Egg solids                   .30 – .40%
5. Stabilizer                   .20 – .30%
6. Emulsifier                   .10 – .20%
7. Water                        58.00 – 59.50%
