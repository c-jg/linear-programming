J. D. Williams, Inc., is an investment advisory firm that manages more than $120 million in funds for its numerous clients. 

The company uses an asset allocation model that recommends the portion of each client’s portfolio to be invested in a:
    * Growth fund
    * Income fund
    * Money Market fund
    
To maintain diversity in each client’s portfolio, the firm places limits on the percentage of each portfolio that may be invested in each of the three funds:
    * Growth Fund: between 20% and 40% of the total portfolio value
    * Income Fund: between 20% and 50% of the total portfolio value
    * Money Market Fund: at least 30% of the total portfolio value

In addition, the company attempts to assess the risk tolerance of each client and adjust the portfolio to meet the needs of the individual investor. 
For example, Williams just contracted with a new client who has $800,000 to invest. 
Based on an evaluation of the client’s risk tolerance, Williams assigned a maximum risk index of 0.05 for the client. 
The firm’s risk indicators show the risk of each fund:
    * Growth fund: 0.10,
    * Income fund: 0.07
    * Money market fund: 0.01 

An overall portfolio risk index is computed as a weighted average of the risk rating for the three funds where the weights are the fraction of the client’s portfolio invested in each of the funds. 
Additionally, Williams is currently forecasting annual yields of:
    * Growth fund: 18% 
    * Income fund: 12.5%
    * Money Market fund: 7.5%

Based on the information provided, how should the new client be advised to allocate the $800,000 among the growth, income, and money market funds?
